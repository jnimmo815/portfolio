          <br>Postdoctoral Fellow (10/2011 to.9/2015)  
          Studied double lateral quantum dots including the coulomb interaction between electrons and holes. Investigated electron resonance induced by an electromagnetic field in quantum dot systems. Also studied the use of  this research in quantum computing, and information systems, as well as developed a novel approach to lasing. Supervised students in nano-science research.</p>

          Supervisor’s Name:  Darryl Bing, Chair
          Telephone Number: 919-546-8395
          Assistant Professor/Physics Coordinator (8/2000 to 5/2006)
          Taught all levels of physics, physical science, and taught both semesters of physical chemistry.  Developed new curricula including the design of conventional laboratory experiments as well as laboratory experiments that involve computers and calculators to collect and analyze data.  Organized the speaker series for the Physics area of the Department of Natural Sciences & Mathematics.  Obtained $15,000 for the Physics Area in the spring of 2001. Some achievements included overseeing SACS review to ensure accreditation compliance, and writing the physics section for four proposalsim and was the principal investigator for one proposal.  Served on faculty search committees, and attend official university functions.
